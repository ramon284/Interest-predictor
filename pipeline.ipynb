    "##### Face detector and pose detector\n",
    "The class `face_detector` contains a pretrained version of the `img2pose` model, which is finetuned to on frontal faces (like phone selfie cameras, webcams). It is imported through `py-feat`. It contains a `detection threshold` hyperparameter in the range of `[0,1]`. The model returns a dataframe where each row is a bounding box coordinates accompanied by 3 facial poses. We can also keep track of which frame the bounding box belongs in.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Video cropper\n",
    "The video cropper checks the coordinates of each bounding box to determine the bounding box values closest to the top, bottom, left and right of the screen. It then crops crops the video to a lower resolution while maintaining all the neccessary information to extract features.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Face-tracker\n",
    "The class `face_persistence_model` is based on the `face_recognition` library, using the `face_locations`, `face_encoding` and `face_landmarks `functions. `face_locations` searches a frame for faces and returns bounding box coordinates. `face_encoding` checks these faces to see if they can recognize the person. When it encounters a \"new\" face it saves some metadata. Then when detecting future faces it will check this new face against all the metadata files. `face_landmarks` returns 68 `x` and 68 `y` coordinates, representing the landmarks on a face. \n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs for the model are:\n",
    "1. `TOLERANCE`: A number [0,1] that alters how the model recognizes faces. A too low tolerance leads to the same face getting detected as different unique faces, too high tolerance leads to multiple faces being detected as the same person \n",
    "2. `filename`: The name of the videofile being analyzed. Must contain extension such as \".mp4\".\n",
    "3. `frameSkips`: This integer value represents how often a frame is skipped, i.e. if `frameSkips=3` every 3rd frame is skipped.\n",
    "4. `model`: Face location model choice of `['cnn', 'hog']`. While 'hog' is quicker (especially on CPU), 'cnn' is more accurate and utilizes GPU.\n",
    "5. `modelSize`: Size of the face encoding model, choice of `['small', 'large']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### AU and emotion detector\n",
    "This class containg 2 models, namely a pretrained `XGB` model for detecting AU's and a `svm`/`resmasknet` model for emotion detection, which can be given as an input (`svm` is default).\n",
    "\n",
    "The class uses facial landmarks and video footage as an input.\n",
